# Dual WebSocket Sessions

The kiosk establishes two isolated WebSocket clients so that telephony and remote
UI features can be monitored or reconnected independently.

## Beaverphone session
- **URL:** `ws://192.168.1.60:5001`
- **Purpose:** Bridges dialer events (dial, hangup, DTMF, clear) to the Termux
  backend that powers Beaverphone.
- **Handlers:**
  - `onopen` updates the Beaverphone status event (`beaverphone:ws-status`) to
    `connected`.
  - `onmessage` logs all inbound payloads for debugging.
  - `onclose` sets the status to `disconnected` and schedules a reconnect after
    5 seconds.
  - `onerror` emits an error status without blocking the reconnection timer.
- **Keep alive:** Sends a JSON ping every 30 seconds while connected.

## Remote UI session
- **URL:** `ws://192.168.1.76:6001`
- **Purpose:** Provides a dedicated channel for remote graphical control and
  monitoring separate from Beaverphone traffic.
- **Handlers:**
  - `onopen` clears any pending reconnect timer and emits
    `remote-ui:ws-status` with `connected`.
  - `onmessage` logs inbound payloads and re-emits them via the
    `remote-ui:ws-message` DOM event for renderer listeners.
  - `onclose` emits a `disconnected` status with the close metadata and retries
    after 5 seconds.
  - `onerror` records the failure and schedules the same reconnect logic.

### Accessing the graphical Remote UI

1. **Open the kiosk web page, not the raw WebSocket.** From another device on
   the same network, point a browser to the kiosk IP (for example
   `http://192.168.1.60`). This serves the regular menu interface that the
   Electron shell displays locally, so you get the exact same controls in a
   standard web view.
2. **Let the page establish the WebSocket for you.** The renderer script inside
   the kiosk automatically connects to `ws://192.168.1.76:6001`, dispatches
   status events, and mirrors any Remote UI messages it receives. There is no
   need to open the WebSocket endpoint manuallyâ€”loading the page triggers the
   handshake and keeps it alive with reconnect logic.
3. **Check the connection status.** You can listen for the
   `remote-ui:ws-status` event in the browser console to verify whether the
   socket is connected and which URL is in use. If you see `disconnected`, the
   kiosk will retry every 5 seconds until the Electron host comes back online.
4. **Send commands through the DOM.** Dispatch a `remote-ui:ws-message` custom
   event with the payload you want to transmit. The preload script forwards it
   to the open WebSocket, and every connected Remote UI client receives it.

> **Important:** Do **not** browse directly to `:6001` or `:5001` in a browser.
> These ports are dedicated to background signaling. Always use the base HTTP
> address of the kiosk so that the Electron-rendered UI handles the WebSocket
> negotiation on your behalf.

## Listening for status in the renderer
Both sessions dispatch DOM custom events. Attach listeners in the renderer to
stay informed:

```js
window.addEventListener("beaverphone:ws-status", ({ detail }) => {
  console.log("Beaverphone status", detail.status);
});

window.addEventListener("remote-ui:ws-status", ({ detail }) => {
  console.log("Remote UI status", detail.status, detail.url);
});

window.addEventListener("remote-ui:ws-message", ({ detail }) => {
  console.log("Remote UI payload", detail.message);
});
```
